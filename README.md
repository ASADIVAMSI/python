**Basic python programming** 


The classic hello world program

          print("Hello World")

          print('Hello world')
     
          print("Hello ,I am Ironman")
 
 
**variables** 


variables store data 

      name="John wick"
      print(name)

 **Strings**

 
  A sequence data type which stores a character (i.e A group of characters is called a string or just one character sometimes :)
  In python anything in between quotes either " " or ' ' is a string

       name="Ironman"
       space="" # just one space character
       nums="123456789"
       symbols="!@#$%^&*()"
       pc='tron'

       print(name , space , nums , symbols , pc)
